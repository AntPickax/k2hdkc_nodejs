# K2HDKC Node.js
K2HDKC Node.js is a library used by client side programs of [K2HDKC](https://k2hdkc.antpick.ax/) which is distributed KVS published by Yahoo! JAPAN as open source.
K2HDKC Node.js is used to connect to [K2HDKC](https://k2hdkc.antpick.ax/) from the server side JavaScript environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and perform data manipulation.
This library is implemented as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ja/) addon library in the server side JavaScript environment and provides all the client functions of the [K2HDKC](https://k2hdkc.antpick.ax/) library.

## The purpose
